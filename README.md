# OVERVIEW of project
This project involves the implementation of a supervised machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify emails as spam or not spam. The goal is to build a model that can learn from historical email data and predict the likelihood of future emails being spam.

1.The complete ML pipeline includes:
2.Data loading and preprocessing
3.Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4.Feature extraction using TF-IDF
5.Model training and tuning
6.Model evaluation using standard metrics

#TECHNOLOGIES USED
Technology	                Description
Python 3.x	                Programming Language
Jupyter Notebook	          Interactive development environment
Scikit-learn	              ML library for training and evaluation
Pandas & NumPy	            Data manipulation and numerical computation
Matplotlib & Seaborn	      Data visualization
NLTK / re (optional)	      Text processing and cleaning

#FEATURES OF THE PROJECT
Preprocessing of raw email text (removing HTML tags, punctuation, etc.)
Feature engineering using TF-IDF Vectorization
Training using models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and/or Random Forest
Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
Evaluation using metrics like:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve
